/**
 * A port of Blackman and Vigna's xoroshiro 128+ generator; should be very fast and produce high-quality output.
 * Testing shows it is within 5% the speed of LightRNG, sometimes faster and sometimes slower, and has a larger period.
 * It's called XoRo because it involves Xor as well as Rotate operations on the 128-bit pseudo-random state.
 * <br>
 * [LightRNG] is also very fast, but relative to XoRoRNG it has a significantly shorter period (the amount of
 * random numbers it will go through before repeating), at {@code pow(2, 64)} as opposed to XorRNG and XoRoRNG's
 * {@code pow(2, 128) - 1}, but LightRNG also allows the current RNG state to be retrieved and altered with
 * {@code getState()} and {@code setState()}. For most cases, you should decide between LightRNG, XoRoRNG, and other
 * RandomnessSource implementations based on your needs for period length and state manipulation (LightRNG is also used
 * internally by almost all StatefulRNG objects). You might want significantly less predictable random results, which
 * [IsaacRNG] and [Isaac32RNG] can provide, along with a large period. You may want a very long period of
 * random numbers, which would suggest [LongPeriodRNG] as a good choice. You may want better performance on
 * 32-bit machines, which would mean [PintRNG] (for generating only ints via [PintRNG#next(int)], since
 * its [PintRNG#nextLong()] method is very slow) or [FlapRNG] (for generating ints and longs at very good
 * speed using mainly int math). You shouldn't rely on 32-bit RandomnessSources on GWT, though, because 32-bit overflow
 * behaves differently there than desktop or Android, and results will change. [LapRNG] is the fastest generator
 * we have, but has a poor period for its state size, and much worse quality than this generator.
